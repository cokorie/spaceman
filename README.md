# Spaceman

__Spaceman__
The objective of winning Spaceman is to be able to identify the secret word, displayed in underscore spaces in the website window, before the 6 alotted chances to do so have been used.

The player will be able to click on the letter buttons at the bottom of the page to begin guessing any given letter in the word. As each letter guess is either correct or incorrect, the corresponding button will update its background color from gray to green (correct guess) or red (incorrect guess). After the player has guessed a given letter, the letter will not be able to be re-selected.

Also, as each incorrect guess is given, an image of a "Spaceman" will slowly be unveiled in 6 parts, for each incorrect guess. When the entire "Spaceman" is visible, the player has lost the game and will have the option to replay by clicking the "Replay?" button at the bottom of the page.

As each incorrect guess is given by the player, a message will also display at the top of the page to let them know how many guesses are still available to them. After the given guesses have finished, a message to try again will display, along with the replay button at the bottom of the screen.

If the player successfully guesses the word before their 6 chances are finished, a message congratulating the player on winning will display at the top of the page, along with the replay button.
